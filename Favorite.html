<h2>Jollof Rice with chilken</h2>
<h3>Methods</h3>



<p><b><u><em>STEP1</b></em></u></p>

<p>Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large deep frying pan over a high 
heat then add the meat and fry for about 5 mins till golden all over. Lift out of the pan onto a plate.</p>

<p><b><u><em>STEP2</b></em></u></p>

<br>Add the rest of the oil to the pan and fry the onions until soft but not golden, about 5 mins. While the onions cook, make the ginger and chilli base. Put the garlic, tomatoes, ginger and chilli 
into a food processor or blender and whizz till smooth.</p>

<p><b><u><em>STEP3</b></em></u></p>

<br>Add the tomato purée to the onions, fry for another 2 mins then add the ginger and chilli mix. Crumble in the stock cube, stir then pour in 600ml boiling water. 
Add the chicken, bring to the boil then simmer for 15 mins.</p>

<p><b><u><em>STEP4</b></em></u></p>

<br>Put the rice into a large bowl, cover with cold water and use your hands to wash the grains. Tip the water out then repeat twice until the water runs clear. Add the rice to the pan, turn the heat down to a simmer then cover with foil and a lid 
(so no steam can escape) and cook for 20 mins.</p>

<p><b><u><em>STEP5</b></em></u></p>

<br>
Take the lid off (the rice won’t be cooked yet) then scatter the peppers and okra over the rice. Re-cover and cook for 10 mins until the veg 
is softened and the rice tender. Just before serving, mix the veg through and scatter over coriander.</p>
